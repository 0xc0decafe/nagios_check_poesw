Nagios plugin to check PoE power consumption of cheap chinese switches

I use this plugin with LibreNMS and a 'ZX-AFGW-SWTG218ANS-150' 8 Port 2.5G PoE switch of the [HORACO brand](https://aliexpress.com/item/1005007219251113.html).
Should work with a bunch of switches sold under different brands and names with and without Poe, see [STH Forum](https://forums.servethehome.com/index.php?threads/horaco-2-5gbe-managed-switch-8-x-2-5gbe-1-10gb-sfp.41571/).

The script could easily be extended to gather other information from the device.
